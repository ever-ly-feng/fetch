## Prerequisites

Before running the Flask app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Install Python:

   If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Install Flask:

   Once Python is installed, open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command to install Flask using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```
## Running the App
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ever-ly-feng/fetch.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
    ```bash
    cd flask-receipts-app
   
3. Run the Flask App:
    ```bash
    python app.py
   ```
    This will start the Flask development server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running.
